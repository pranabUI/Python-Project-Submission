The Movie Master Pro App project is a two-part application developed in Python, combining web scraping, data processing, and a graphical user interface (GUI) to create a dynamic and interactive movie recommendation tool. The project aims to provide users with curated movie suggestions based on genres, IMDb ratings, release years, and other attributes, enhancing the movie-watching experience by making it easier to discover new films.

imdb_movie_scraper program - The first Python program is designed to build a bot that scrapes data from IMDb to suggest movies based on user preferences. This program specifically scrapes the IMDb Top 250 movies page to extract movie details, including movie names, release years, durations, genres, IMDb ratings, directors, main cast members, plots, and poster URLs. It then stores the scraped data in a CSV file for further use or analysis.

movie_master_pro_app program - The second Python program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for the movie suggestion app using tkinter. It leverages the movie data extracted from IMDb and saved in a CSV file (from the first program) to allow users to explore and select movies based on genres, ratings, release years, and more.

Libraries Used: requests - For sending HTTP requests to fetch HTML content from IMDb pages. BeautifulSoup - For parsing HTML content to extract structured data embedded in the page. re - For using regular expressions to parse movie durations and convert them to a human-readable format. pandas - For creating DataFrames to store the extracted movie details and exporting them to a CSV file. tkinter - For creating the graphical user interface. It provides the main window, frames, labels, buttons, and text widgets for displaying content. ast - For safely evaluating string representations of Python data structures (e.g., converting genre strings back to lists).
